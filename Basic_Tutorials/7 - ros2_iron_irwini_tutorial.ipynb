    "# Installing ROS 2 Iron Irwini with Gazebo and RViz on Ubuntu 24.04 (WSL2)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the installation of ROS 2 Iron Irwini, Gazebo, and RViz on **Ubuntu 24.04** hosted on **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux). \n",
    "\n",
    "**ROS 2** (Robot Operating System) is an open-source framework for building robot applications. The ROS ecosystem has been a driving force in the robotics world for many years, and Iron Irwini is one of its more recent distributions. It includes essential features such as middleware communication, hardware abstraction, and tools like Gazebo for simulation and RViz for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have the following installed and configured:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Windows 11** with WSL2 enabled\n",
    "2. **Ubuntu 24.04** on WSL2\n",
    "3. **X410** or similar for GUI display\n",
    "4. **GPU passthrough** enabled (for simulation and RViz acceleration)\n",
    "5. **CUDA** (if you're using NVIDIA for GPU-accelerated computation)\n",

    "## Step 1: Setting Up the ROS 2 Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we’ll add the ROS 2 Iron Irwini repository to our Ubuntu 24.04 environment. ROS 2 relies on Ubuntu's packaging system, so it’s important that we configure the repository and key correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, ensure your package list is up to date:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, install the necessary dependencies for adding the ROS 2 repository and managing your sources:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install software-properties-common curl gnupg2 -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the ROS 2 GPG key and repository to your system:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -\n",
    "sudo add-apt-repository universe\n",
    "sudo add-apt-repository multiverse\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add the ROS 2 Iron Irwini repository by setting the correct source list file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb [trusted=yes] https://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list'\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",

    "## Step 2: Installing ROS 2 Iron Irwini\n",
    "\n",
    "With the repository added, we can now install ROS 2 Iron.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the base ROS 2 packages:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install ros-iron-desktop -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the core ROS 2 packages along with some commonly used tools like **Rviz**, the graphical visualization tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Source your ROS environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash\" >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you should have ROS 2 Iron Irwini successfully installed on your system. You can verify it by running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ros2 --version\n",
    "```\n"

    "\n",
    "ROS 2 integrates very well with **Gazebo**, a powerful simulator for robotics, and **RViz**, a 3D visualization tool. Let’s install these next.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Gazebo and its ROS 2 integration packages:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install ros-iron-gazebo-ros-pkgs -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install RViz (if it wasn’t installed with the desktop option earlier):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install ros-iron-rviz2 -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should have both Gazebo and RViz installed on your system. To check their versions and ensure everything works:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gazebo --version\n",
    "rviz2 --version\n",
    "```\n"

    "## Step 4: Creating a ROS 2 Launcher Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make it easier to start ROS 2 by creating a launcher file. This script will set up your environment and launch ROS 2, Gazebo, and RViz with a single command.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new bash script in your home directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nano ~/ros2_launcher.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the following lines to the script:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "# Source the ROS 2 setup file\n",
    "source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set environment variables (optional, adjust for your setup)\n",
    "export DISPLAY=:0  # Required for X410\n",
    "export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/share/gazebo-11\n",
    "\n",
    "# Launch ROS, Gazebo, and RViz\n",
    "echo \"Launching ROS 2, Gazebo, and RViz...\"\n",
    "ros2 launch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch.py &\n",
    "rviz2 &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make the script executable:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod +x ~/ros2_launcher.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start everything with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./ros2_launcher.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script sources the ROS 2 environment, sets up the display for X410 (which ensures that graphical applications run), and then launches Gazebo and RViz.\n"

    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have now successfully installed **ROS 2 Iron Irwini** along with **Gazebo** and **RViz** on your WSL2 Ubuntu environment. You’ve also created a custom launcher script for quickly setting up and starting your ROS development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup provides a robust environment for robotics development and simulation, with the added benefit of GPU acceleration and full X11 support thanks to **X410**. By using **WSL2**, you’re bridging the gap between Windows and Linux, combining the best of both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck with your robotics projects, and feel free to experiment with additional ROS 2 packages or customizations for your workflow!\n"
