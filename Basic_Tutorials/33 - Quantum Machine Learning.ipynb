    "\n",
    "Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can be in a superposition of states. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n",

    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Superposition**: A qubit can be in a combination of 0 and 1 states simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Entanglement**: Qubits can be correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit instantly affects the state of another, regardless of distance.\n",
    "- **Interference**: Quantum states can interfere with each other, leading to constructive or destructive interference."
