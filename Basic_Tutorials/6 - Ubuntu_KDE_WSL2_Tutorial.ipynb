    "# **Setting Up Ubuntu 24.04 with KDE Plasma Desktop on WSL2 with X410 and GPU Support**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through installing **Ubuntu 24.04** on **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux), configuring it with the **KDE Plasma desktop environment**, and using **X410** as an XServer on a **Windows 11** host. We will also enable GPU acceleration and provide steps to configure the system for smooth graphical performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "WSL2 brings a near-native Linux experience to Windows, and with the ability to run full graphical Linux desktops like KDE Plasma, the experience is even closer to a traditional Linux environment. With GPU support in WSL2, it’s also possible to run GPU-accelerated applications, making it a powerful development environment for software developers.\n",

    "Before installing Ubuntu 24.04, ensure that WSL2 is enabled on your Windows machine.\n",
