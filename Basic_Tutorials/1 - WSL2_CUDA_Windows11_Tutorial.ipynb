    "## Introduction\n",
    "With the rise of data science and machine learning projects, developers often need access to powerful tools and environments that support heavy computational tasks. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 and NVIDIA's CUDA are pivotal in providing such capabilities on Windows machines. This tutorial post explores how to combine the versatility of Linux with the computational power of NVIDIA GPUs through WSL 2 on Windows 11, offering a seamless and potent development environment.  This tutorial will guide you through setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 with CUDA support for GPU computing on Windows 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why WSL 2 with CUDA?\n",
    "WSL 2 offers a genuine Linux kernel running directly on Windows 11, providing remarkable performance improvements and full system call compatibility. This is a game-changer for developers who prefer or require Linux's flexibility but need or want to stay within the Windows ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating CUDA into this setup allows developers to leverage NVIDIA GPUs for tasks requiring massive parallel computing power, such as deep learning and complex simulations. This capability significantly speeds up computing tasks and supports a broader range of development activities directly from a Windows environment.\n",
