    "## Introduction\n",
    "As developers seek more efficient and scalable solutions for application development, tools like Docker and enhancements like Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 become invaluable. This tutorial guides you through setting up Docker on WSL 2 with the integration of Ollama, enhancing your development environment on Windows 11.\n",

    "### Why Docker on WSL 2 with Ollama?\n",
    "Combining Docker with WSL 2 allows developers to harness the robustness of Linux and the containerization benefits of Docker directly on a Windows system. Ollama further simplifies the deployment and management of large language models and other intensive applications within this setup, offering a streamlined workflow for development and deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docker ensures your applications run consistently across different environments by using containers.\n",
    "- WSL 2 provides a genuine Linux kernel that improves performance and compatibility over its predecessor.\n",
    "- Ollama facilitates the easy setup and use of machine learning models, making it ideal for developers looking to integrate AI capabilities into their applications."
